# Python-Projects
Projects and scripts 

videoRename:
Can rename and/or move files
Reason:
Needed to "convert" aka rename a bunch of GoPro "LPV" files to MP4 so I could view them without GoPro's software.

amountPaid:
Script that takes in hourly pay and amount of hours and returns the values once taxes + an assumed fee % is removed.
Reason:
Something that I make in excel from time to time but I thought I would explore making it in Python.
